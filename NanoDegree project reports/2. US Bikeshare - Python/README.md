# US Bikeshare

This notebook gives an example of a data exploration assignment, where you've been handed a dataset and it's on you to clean, analyze, and visualize the data. Even though the analysis is a bit light in the notebook, it shows well the process of data analysis.

This project is about exploring the US Bikeshare dataset, where you're given the bikeshare data of three cities and our goal is to figure out some statistics that can give us information that can benefit the company.
