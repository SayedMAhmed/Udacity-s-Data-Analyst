# Explore Weather Trends

This report is a summary of the weather trends data analysis. It explains the process of acquiring and analyzing the data.

We start by collecting the data from a database with SQL, and then using Google Sheets to perfrom specific calculations.

These calculations include 7-year moving average for every data point. 
A moving average is used here to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.

Using these calculations we were able to visualize the data, which showed us patterns we can analyze.

Finally we came up with observations that translates the data well and answered several questions about weather trends.
